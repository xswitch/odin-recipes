    <h3>A quick and simple meal, with a plethora of ways to customize it</h3>
    <p>One of the most popular dishes in the United States known as mac and cheese combines tender, yet firm pasta and melted cheese. The preferred American combination includes curved macaroni pasta and Cheddar cheese, but modern varieties include various vegetables, crispy breadcrumb topping, or gourmet ingredients such as crab, lobster, or truffles.</p>
